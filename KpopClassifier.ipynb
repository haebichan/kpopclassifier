    "# The (Data) Science of Kpop:   Understanding BTS through Data and A.I.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Many media outlets have raised and answered their own question of what makes BTS so unique compared to other K-pop groups. Their answers, whether from Vox or Time magazine, aren't really well-supported by evidence, such as the claim that BTS is unique because of \"confucian values\" or \"group synchrony\". Fortunately, we have data science, where we can use both traditional and cutting-edge techniques to scientifically explore BTS' true uniqueness, if such a thing exists. This notebook examines two major aspect of BTS: their songs and their lyrics. As many fans have claimed that BTS' lyrics are different compared to their competitors (as well as their music), I will examine and answer these two major claims in this notebook."

    "1) Obtain the musical features of recently popular k-pop groups using Spotify's API. Parse json files in order to store these features in a workable dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use BeautifulSoup to webscrape translated English lyrics of k-pop songs from these groups. The lyrics will be used for Natural Language Processing and building k-pop classifier using texts.\n",

    "Audio Features meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"acousticness\": A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"danceability\": Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"energy\": Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"instrumentalness\": Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"liveness\": Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"speechiness\": Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words\n",
    "\n",
    "\"valence\": A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."

    "- The Feature Impact of _LightGBMClassifier_ on model output. I base Feature Impact partly on the SHAP values, based on the Shapley value that calculates how much each feature individually contributes to the final prediction, negatively or positively. One huge advantage of SHAP values is their local interpretability, meaning that each individual in our data is also assigned with his/her own SHAP value, allowing analysis on a 'local' level. The charts below will clarify what this means."

    ">__How to read the chart__: The SHAP value is a mathematic calculation of how much each feature individually contributes to our machines  predicting if a certain song is by BTS or not.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The left y-axis shows that the higher the features are on the list, the more impact they have on the model predicting whether a certain song is by BTS. In other words, speechiness had the most impact on the model prediction. Also, the chart plots every SHAP value for every datapoint in our 11 musical features. Thus, each dot (representing each song) in the chart is unique.\n",
    "The magnitude of positive and negative influence on model output is shown by how spread out the dots are from the center. Positivity and negativity are measured through a specific formula that I won't go into here. Colors blue and red in the chart represent their feature value. For instance, the red dots represent the higher levels of speechiness and the blue represents the lower values speechiness.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If you combine this entire information, the plot above shows that speechiness is the most important feature for model prediction. The higher the number of speechiness, the more that song influenced our machines in predicting it to be from BTS. This conversely means that the model predicts lower levels  of speechiness to be associated with non-BTS groups. \n",
    "Liveness , our second most important feature, is a little more intricate, in that lower levels of liveness has a strong influence over non-BTS predictions, but the opposite is not the case, where higher recordings of liveness don't strongly influence BTS predictions."

    "Permutation Importance is another good way of measuring feature importance, though the technique is much older than the SHAP Value. Its idea is very similar to SHAP Values in trying to measure how much the prediction score (accuracy, roc_auc, etc.) decreases when a feature is not available. The measurement is done by shuffling the features and measuring the model performance. Given their similar aims, it is no surprising that the output ranking is the same. However, the Permutation Importance doesn't tell us the direction of impact like SHAP Values. Nonetheless, it's a good tool to have."

    "\n",
    "__LIME__, or Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, is a great tool for measuring which words in a particular document influence our classifiers and toward what direction (BTS or non-BTS). We first have to vectorize our words into a matrix, fit the matrix into our model, and deploy the LIME from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be mentioned LIME only works with word embedding that doesn't change dimension of the original vector space, such as count vectorizer, tfidf, etc. Doc2Vec will not work on LIME since the model transforms the original matrix of our vectorized words during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a standard problem of model complexity vs. model interpretability. Doc2Vec word representations will generally grant higher performance for our classifiers (if the document has lots of words). But you will unfortunately lose model interpretability. If you want lower model performance but higher interpretabiity, LIME and Tfidf is a great choice (again, based on the size of our documents). \n",
